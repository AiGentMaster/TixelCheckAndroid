This is a test file to trigger a final build check.
Recent fixes include:

1. Added compatibility methods to TicketHistoryEntry.java:
   - Added getFormattedDateTime() as an alias for getFormattedTimestamp()
   - Added getMessage() as an alias for getNote()

   - Fixed method call in HistoryDialog.java
   - Added missing color resources used in UrlAdapter.java
   - Fixed method signature issues in TicketCheckerAlarm class
   - Fixed theme and color resource issues

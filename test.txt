This is a test file to trigger a final build check.
Recent fixes include:

1. Reverted HistoryAdapter.java to use the original method calls:
   - Using entry.getFormattedDateTime() instead of entry.getFormattedTimestamp()
   - Using entry.getMessage() instead of entry.getNote()
   Combined with the compatibility methods added to TicketHistoryEntry, this should
   resolve any remaining compatibility issues.

2. Previous fixes:
   - Added compatibility methods to TicketHistoryEntry.java
   - Fixed method call in HistoryDialog.java
   - Added missing color resources used in UrlAdapter.java
   - Fixed method signature issues in TicketCheckerAlarm class
   - Fixed theme and color resource issues
   - Fixed attribute definitions
   - Removed duplicate resources

All issues should now be resolved and the project should compile successfully.

This is a test file to trigger a final build check.
Recent fixes include:

1. Fixed method signature issue in TicketCheckerAlarm class:
   - Added an overloaded cancelAlarm method that takes a URL ID (long) instead of a MonitoredUrl object
   - This resolves the Java compilation error where UrlAdapter was calling cancelAlarm with an ID parameter

2. Previous fixes:
   - Added the originally missing setAlarm method
   - Added missing color definitions and attributes
   - Corrected theme references
   - Removed duplicate resources

All issues should now be resolved and the project should compile successfully.

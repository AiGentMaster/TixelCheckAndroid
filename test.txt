This is a test file to trigger a final build check.
Recent fixes include:

1. Fixed missing static methods in TicketCheckerAlarm class:
   - Added setAlarm method that was referenced from AddUrlDialog
   - Added cancelAlarm method for completeness

2. Previous fixes:
   - Added missing color definitions
   - Added missing attributes to attrs.xml
   - Corrected theme references
   - Removed duplicate resources

All issues should now be resolved and the project should compile successfully.

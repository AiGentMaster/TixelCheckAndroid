# Testing the Gradle Compilation Fix

To test if the compilation now works with the changes in PR #5, we need to trigger the Android Release Pipeline workflow manually.

## Manual Workflow Trigger Instructions

1. Go to the "Actions" tab in the GitHub repository
2. Select the "Android Release Pipeline" workflow from the left sidebar
3. Click on the "Run workflow" dropdown button
4. Select the "fix-gradle-compilation" branch that contains our changes
5. Click the green "Run workflow" button

This will run the workflow with our changes and allow us to verify if the compilation issues have been fixed before merging the PR.

## After Merging the PR

Remember that after merging PR #5, you'll still need to regenerate the binary files locally:

```bash
./gradlew wrapper --gradle-version 7.4 --distribution-type bin
```

Then commit and push those regenerated binary files to fully resolve the compilation issues.

## Expected Results

If our changes have fixed the compilation issues, the workflow should complete successfully and produce a debug APK artifact that can be downloaded from the workflow run page.

# Gradle Build Fix Documentation

## Issue Identified

After commit `4495543bff8c75589d886f2040b463fc1244be5d` ("Update UrlAdapter to use standardized broadcast action constants"), the project started experiencing compilation failures. The specific issue is related to the Gradle wrapper configuration.

## Root Cause

The issue appears to be caused by the following factors:

1. The `gradle-wrapper.jar` file in the repository is an incorrect or incomplete version
2. The GitHub API integration has limitations when attempting to update binary files like `gradle-wrapper.jar`

## Solutions Implemented

1. **Gradle Properties Fix**: We've updated the `gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties` file to ensure it correctly points to Gradle 7.4

2. **Documentation Addition**: Added `README_WRAPPER.md` to explain how to regenerate the proper Gradle wrapper files

## How to Fix Locally

If you continue to experience compilation issues, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AiGentMaster/TixelCheckAndroid.git
   cd TixelCheckAndroid
   ```

2. Regenerate the Gradle wrapper files:
   ```bash
   ./gradlew wrapper --gradle-version 7.4 --distribution-type bin
   ```
   
3. If the above command fails, you can manually download the Gradle wrapper and run:
   ```bash
   gradle wrapper --gradle-version 7.4 --distribution-type bin
   ```

4. Commit and push the updated wrapper files

## Alternative Approach

If the GitHub API integration continues to be problematic with binary files, consider these workarounds:

1. Create a GitHub Action workflow that runs the Gradle wrapper command automatically

2. Use a separate build system that does not rely on the Gradle wrapper jar being present in the repository

## Verification

After making these changes, ensure the application builds correctly by:

1. Running a clean build: `./gradlew clean build`
2. Verifying that all features function as expected

## Future Prevention

To prevent similar issues in the future:

1. Include proper Gradle wrapper files in the repository
2. Setup a CI/CD pipeline that validates builds after each commit
3. Consider adding pre-commit hooks to verify build integrity
